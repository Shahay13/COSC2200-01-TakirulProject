    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="gameRulesTextLabel.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>1. Objective: The goal of the game is to get rid of any heart cards in your hand and not win tricks containing hearts. Each heart that you have at the end of each round earns you 1 point, the Queen of Spades is worth 5 points. The object of the game is to have the lowest number of points.

2. Setup: The game is played with 4 players and a standard 52-card deck. The first dealer is chosen by drawing cards, the highest value is the first dealer. A second draw is made in the circumstances of a tie. The dealer then moves to the left (clockwise) each hand moving forward. The deck is shuffled very well, and then all cards are dealt to the players (13 cards to each of 4 players).

3. Card Ranking: There is no trump suit in this game, and if possible, players must follow the suit of the leading card. Cards are simply ranked from Ace-high to 2-low in each suit, there is no trump suit.

4. Round Play: Each hand consists of 13 rounds where each player will play 1 card. The first round is lead by the player to the left of the dealer. The lead player in a round may play any card from their hand, except a heart if a heart has not been played yet. Once a heart has been played in any round, then a heart may be used as a lead card at any time thereafter. Each player in a clockwise direction, must then play a card from their hand. If they hold a card of the same suit of the lead card, they should play that card, otherwise they may play any card. The round is won by the player who played the highest card of the same suit as the lead card. The player who won the trick collects the cards and places them face-down in front of them for later counting. The player who won the round, then also plays the lead card of the next round.

5. Scoring: Once all 13 rounds have been completed, then each player then counts how many hearts they have in the pile of cards in front of them. Each heart will count as 1 point and the Queen of Spades will count as 5 points. The next hand is dealt by the player clockwise from the player who dealt the previous hand.

6. Winning: Before starting the game, the group will decide on how many points will end the game. Typically, this is 50 or 100 points. When a single player reaches the score limit, the game ends. The player with the lowest score at this point is declared the winner.
